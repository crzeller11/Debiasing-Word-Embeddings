## Objective
This project is a senior comprehensive project, studying methods for reducing the amount of inherited bias in word embeddings. Utilizing Gensim to parse Wikipedia text, FastText to train the embeddings, and [research from Bolukbasi et al. (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520), I am attempting to reduce one Direct Bias statistic across modesl trained with different quantities of data, across different definitions of gender, and across different kinds of gender-neutral words in English.
